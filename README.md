#### Spring Web MVC [Details From Javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-mvc-tutorial)

- Model - A model contains the data of the application. A data can be a single object or a collection of objects.

- Controller - A controller contains the business logic of an application. Here, the @Controller annotation is used to mark the class as the controller.

- View - A view represents the provided information in a particular format. Generally, JSP+JSTL is used to create a view page. Although spring also supports other view technologies such as Apache Velocity, Thymeleaf and FreeMarker.

- Front Controller - In Spring Web MVC, the DispatcherServlet class works as the front controller. It is responsible to manage the flow of the Spring MVC application.

## Spring Data JPA

- Spring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories. This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.
